# Operating-Systems-Project
All Scheduling Algos and Gantt Chart Code

Second Year Project for calculating the Average Turn Around time and Average Waiting Time of a particular scheduling algorithm.

This code contains all 6 Scheduling Algorithms:-
1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
3. Shortest Job Remaining Time First (SJRTF)
4. Priority Scheduling (Non - Preemptive)
5. Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)
6. Round Robin

A Gantt Chart of these is also displyed for each Scheduling Algorithm making it easier to visulaise how the jobs will be processed by our operating systems.
